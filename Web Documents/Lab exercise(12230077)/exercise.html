<!-- 1.Changing the values of the box-shadow property, 
    such as offset, blur radius, and colour, can change the perceived depth of the box. 
    Increasing the blur radius can produce a softer, more diffused shadow,
     creating the illusion of a greater distance between the box and its background. 
     Adjusting the offset can alter the direction from which the light source appears to be casting the shadow,
      influencing the perceived depth.
    
      2.Applying a linear gradient to an element creates a smooth transition between two or more specified colors. 
      This can add depth, dimension, and visual interest to the element. Unlike a solid background color, which remains uniform throughout,
       a linear gradient blends colors seamlessly, creating a dynamic appearance that can enhance the overall aesthetic of the element.

       3. Applying a 2D rotation rotates the element along the plane of the screen, affecting only its appearance in two dimensions. 
       On the other hand, a 3D transformation introduces depth by allowing rotation along additional axes, such as the X, Y, and Z axes. 
       The presence of perspective in a 3D transformation affects the visual perception of depth and distance. Elements appear smaller as they move away
        from the viewer and larger as they move closer, creating a more realistic and immersive visual experience.

        4. The CSS transition property is crucial for creating visually appealing animations, allowing gradual changes over time.
         It's important to balance duration, timing function, and easing for a natural, intuitive experience, and optimize transitions 
         for performance across different devices and browsers.
